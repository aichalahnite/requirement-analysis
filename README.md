# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 🧠 Introduction

Welcome to the Requirement Analysis documentation for a **Booking Management System**.  
This repository serves as a blueprint for understanding, documenting, and visualizing the critical early phase of software development — *Requirement Analysis*.

This phase lays the groundwork for successful development by defining what the system must do (*functional requirements*) and how it should perform (*non-functional requirements*).  
By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive document that simulates the preparation needed before implementation begins in a real-world scenario.

## 📖 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a foundational stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers, stakeholders, and clients collaborate to determine:

- What the system should do (features and functions)
- How users will interact with the system
- Constraints the system must operate within
- Acceptance criteria for validating deliverables

It involves gathering, documenting, validating, and managing software requirements to ensure clarity, completeness, and agreement before development begins.

**Without clear requirements, projects often face:**

- Scope creep  
- Missed deadlines  
- Budget overruns  
- Misaligned outcomes  

Effective requirement analysis ensures developers build the right product the right way.

## 🎯 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical to the success of any software project. Here are key reasons why:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication**  
   Ensures a shared understanding between stakeholders, clients, and developers.

2. **Enables Better Planning**  
   Clear requirements help in accurate estimation of timelines and resources.

3. **Minimizes Rework**  
   Fewer revisions during development, saving time and money.

4. **Ensures Quality and Alignment**  
   Measurable acceptance criteria ensure the software meets business and user goals.

## 🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement analysis involves several interrelated activities:

- **📋 Requirement Gathering**  
  Collect data via interviews, surveys, and observation.

- **🔎 Requirement Elicitation**  
  Use techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and use case development.

- **📝 Requirement Documentation**  
  Use SRS documents and user stories.

- **📐 Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Create models such as use case diagrams and DFDs.

- **✅ Requirement Validation**  
  Conduct walkthroughs and reviews with stakeholders.

## ⚙️ Types of Requirements

### 🧩 Functional Requirements

These describe specific behaviors, functions, or features.

Examples for a Booking Management System:

- Users must be able to search for available rooms by date and location.
- Users can make, cancel, or update bookings.
- Admins can view all bookings and modify availability.

### 📊 Non-Functional Requirements

These describe *how* the system performs:

- **Performance**: Respond to user actions within 2 seconds  
- **Scalability**: Support up to 10,000 concurrent users  
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime  
- **Security**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit  
- **Usability**: Accessible UI for people with disabilities, mobile optimization

## 🧾 Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use case diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system’s functionalities (use cases).

### Booking System – Use Case Diagram

**Key Actors:**

- **User**: Can search, book, update, or cancel reservations  
- **Admin**: Manages listings, views analytics, and edits bookings  

**Use Cases:**

- Search Rooms  
- View Booking History  
- Make Reservation  
- Modify Booking  
- Cancel Booking  
- Manage Listings

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be accepted.

### Example – Checkout Feature

| ID     | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| AC-001 | When a user clicks "Checkout", the system must display a secure payment form. |
| AC-002 | The system must validate all required payment fields (card number, CVV, expiration). |
| AC-003 | Payments must be processed through Stripe securely. |
| AC-004 | A confirmation email must be sent after successful payment. |
| AC-005 | Users should see a “Booking Confirmed” screen with their reservation summary. |
